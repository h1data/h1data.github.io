          <ul>
            <li>UI color scheme is now based on Live theme/skin and improved visibility in dark themes...but wait, what's in the red LED??</li>
            <li>Fixed an issue where playing a track with automation for mode (ADSR / LINE) button makes undo histories.</li>
            <li>These changes do not alter automation settings. Live sets which include earlier versions are compatible.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>A change in version 1.0.7 (March 2, 2020)</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Corrected small uneven alignments of UI.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Changes in version 1.0.6 (March 2, 2019)</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Reduced retrigger delay of adsr~ to 1 msec from 10 msec. Now the initial state is ADSR mode which became more reliable.<br>
              The previous version of device's mode in live sets and automation are not affected by this change of the initial state.</li>
            <li>Removed some redundant processes and reduced idling CPU use by about 9% off. (1.47% to 1.34% on Core i5-4570 processor)</li>
            <li>Removed the logic which was used to generate the rectangular wave sample but not used for the actual playback.<br>
              If you want to see the logic, you can download as another patch <a href=".\generateRectWave.maxpat">here</a>.</li>
            <li>Fixed an issue where changing SENSE is not reflected while playing.</li>
            <li>Fixed an issue where changing OUTPUT, SENSE, and SUSTAIN while playing cause noise.</li>
            <li>Fixed an issue where the sound was interrupted in the duration before the change if SUSTAIN was changed longer while sounding.</li>

        <li>Due to some VSTi or MIDI instruments carry on the velocity of preceding continuous notes,
          echoes may not be decayed or new MIDI notes might sounds low.<br>
          Sometimes other pitch notes' velocity may be carried in mono mode.<br>
          Setting Delay time about 40 msec might resolve these issues.</li>

            When the button is on, actual note offs and the start of echoes are suspended until all actual playing notes were off, and echoes are stopped by receiving any new notes.</li>
          <li>Fixed an issue when echoes would not be stopped by receiving the same notes and new notes would not play correctly.</li>
          <li>The internal note on velocity values are now calculated in float to prevent repeating echo notes endlessly.</li>

      <ul>
        <li>While notes playing, changing some parameters does not effect until the next bound, not in real-time.<br>
          It is necessary to change most of the patch code (the way to manage by CPU time such as Note Echo in Max for Live Essentials) for correcting this issue,<br>
          however, no one might want to manipulate gravity in real-time.</li>
        <li>Playing many notes at a time causes some CPU usage. (might be caused by the instruments after this device)<br>
          Disabling DISP switch may reduce CPU usage. Future updates may introduce light display mode without sprites.</li>
        <li>Bouncing balls might be not displayed properly when inverse mode.
          Because the display supposed the maximum note velocity is 127, however,
          the velocity of balls increases without limit when inverse mode.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>Added the inverted bouncing feature at last! The bouncing is inverted when Inv. button is on.<br>
            Each time pressing Inv. button makes undo histories.
            So it is recommended to automate Inv. button when it is toggled repeatedly.</li>
          <li>Added Velocity parameter to adjust the initial velocity (of balls).<br>
            Setting the Velocity value low works effectively with the inverted mode.<br>
            Also adjusted the UI including other parameter's font.</li>
          <li>Changed he initial value of Minimum to 50msec from 100msec.</li>
