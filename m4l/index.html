            <li>Removed some redundant processes and reduced idling CPU use by about 9% off. (1.47% to 1.34% on Core i5-4570 processor)</li>
            <li>Removed the logic which was used to generate the rectangular wave sample but not used for the actual playback.<br/>

          <li>Due to some VSTi or MIDI instruments carry on the velocity of preceding continuous notes,
            echoes may not be decayed or new MIDI notes might sounds low.<br/>

        <ul>
          <li>Gravity: Represents the gravity; how fast the velocity of balls decreases.</li>

          <li>Rebound: Represents the coefficient of restitution. It's often written 'e'.
            As increasing Rebound, the velocity of echo notes decreases slower.</li>
          <li>Vel D/W: Represents Velocity Dry/Wet ratio as known as velocity sensitivity.</li>
          <li>Duration: Adjusts the ratio between the duration time of echo notes and bounces.</li>
          <li>Minimum: The minimum bouncing time. It depends on 'HOLD' switch the behavior at the duration between bounces reached Minimum.</li>
          <li>HOLD: When enabled, bouncing notes continue after the duration of bounces reached 'Minimum' time.<br/>
            When disabled, bounces end at duration time of bounces reached 'Minimum' time.</li>
          <li>DISP: Enable or disable the dynamic display animation.</li>
          <li>Inverse: When enabled, the bounces are inverted; the duration of notes increases.<br/>
            TIP: When inverse mode, you can start bounces from shorter duration by setting 'Velocity' to a small number (2-3).</li>

        <ul>
          <li>While notes playing, changing some parameters does not effect until the next bound, not in real-time.<br/>
            It is necessary to change most of the patch code (the way to manage by CPU time such as Note Echo in Max for Live Essentials) for correcting this issue,<br/>
            however, no one might want to manipulate gravity in real-time.</li>
          <li>Playing many notes at a time causes some CPU usage. (might be caused by the instruments after this device)<br/>

            <li>Added the inverted bouncing feature at last! The bouncing is inverted when Inv. button is on.<br/>
              Each time pressing Inv. button makes undo histories.
              So it is recommended to automate Inv. button when it is toggled repeatedly.</li>
            <li>Added Velocity parameter to adjust the initial velocity (of balls).<br/>
              Setting the Velocity value low works effectively with the inverted mode.<br/>
              Also adjusted the UI including other parameter's font.</li>
            <li>Changed he initial value of Minimum to 50msec from 100msec.</li>

          (the last update: October 30, 2022 / version 1.3.3)</p>
        <p>Audio effect device to modulate parameters in integer values and PAL/NTSC like interlace frame rates.<br/>
          Deeply influenced by tracker software and chiptune plugins.</p>
        <h3>Features</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Designed to modulate integer parameters such as semitone, octave and waveform types in instrument devices or plugins.</li>
          <li>Also able to modulate float-value parameters by scaled values.</li>
          <li>4 parameters can be mapped to individual modulations, which sync to the master clock of the device.</li>
          <li>Able to receive MIDI notes to start from the first step again by routing MIDI channel. (only available since Live 11)</li>
        </ul>
      </header>
      <details>
        <summary>Parameters</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>ClockMode: Switches the clock rate in Hz or note-related.</li>
          <li>ClockFrequency: Adjusts the clock frequency in Hz.<br/>
            Actual speed is doubled to simulate interlaced frames. 29.97Hz: NTSC, 25Hz: PAL.</li>
          <li>CLockRate: Adjusts the clock rate with note-related speed.</li>
          <li>ParameterSelector (below Clock): Switches from 4 individual parameter macros.</li>
          <li>Resync: When pressed, reset all current position of parameter macros to sync again.<br/>
            Pressing the button always makes an undo history of Live.<br/>
            TIP: Setting automation to Resync makes attack effect without MIDI input.</li>
          <br/>belows are included in each individual parameter macro.
          <li>Loop Selector (above sliders): Adjusts the loop position.</li>
          <li>Sliders: Adjust each modulation value per frame.</li>
          <li>Values (below sliders): Indicate each modulation value. Able to adjust and be automated.<br/>
            The value can exceed Input Range, but the actual modulation value does not.</li>
          <li>Cycle / Step: Adjusts the number of cycles needed to proceed with each steps. Larger steps make slower progress.</li>
          <li>Input Range: Adjusts the minimum/maximum value of each sliders.</li>
          <li>Scale (S): When enabled, the device scales modulation value to the range of modulated parameters.<br/>
            Suitable for parameters in float.</li>
          <li>Fit: When pressed, fits the values of Input Range to the range of modulated parameter.<br/>
            Suitable for parameters in integer. Available only when the parameter for modulation is mapped.</li>
          <li>0-7F: When pressed, sets input range to [0, 127 (0x7F)].<br/>
            Unavailable when the parameter without number is mapped. (on/off or enumerations)</li>
          <li>+/-: When pressed, sets input range to [-64, 63]. Suitable for bipolar parameters such as pan.<br/>
            Unavailable when the parameter without number is mapped. (on/off or enumerations)</li>
          <li>Map: When pressed, activates mapping mode. You can click a mappable parameter in Live to select as the mapped parameter to modulate.<br/>
            The mapped parameter name is displayed in right of Unmap button (x).</li>
          <li>Unmap (x): When pressed, cancel the mapping of parameter.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>
      <details open>
        <summary>Known issues</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>The clock rate does not affect completely perfect to the actual rate due to internal buffer of modulated devices and Live itself. (10 to 20+ samples in sampling rate = 44.1kHz)</li>
          <li>Might not work as stepwise modulation for parameters such as output volumes which continuously vary in a few mill seconds by changing values.</li>
          <li>Without scaling, the maximum absolute modulation value is 128. It seems enough but cannot modulate if the parameter's range is more than 128.<br/>
            Please inform the author know if there is a device which has parameter value more than 128, especially built-in Live devices.</li>
          <li>Resync button can be automated, however, pressing the button always makes undo histories as a side effect.</li>
          <li>The values below sliders might exceed the input range, however, he actual values in modulation are limited by the input range.</li>

        <summary>Parameters</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Mode: Switches the behavior of movements.<br/>
            Step: Changes position at interval time.<br/>
            Line: moves in a straight line and changes direction at interval time.<br/>
            Curve: Accelerates to the randomized direction. In this mode, the width of movement is halved to suppress overrun by acceleration.<br/>

            <img src="phototactic_modes.png" alt="the image of automation in each mode" /></li>
          <li>Map X / Map Y: Press and select a parameter to map by each coordinate. Press again to cancel mapping.</li>
          <li>Fold (▶) / Unfold (▼) : Toggles to fold/unfold the advanced parameters.</li>
          <li>X-Y Control:<br/>
            Click or drag to move the circle as the attractor. (orange in default Live color themes)<br/>
            Actual effect is represented by moving line. (blue in default Live color themes)</li>
          <li>X Width: Represents the ratio of random line movements for X coordinate.</li>
          <li>Y Width: Represents the ratio of random line movements for Y coordinate.</li>
          <li>Link Width: Toggles to equal the X and Y width.</li>
          <li>Interval: Represents the interval time of line movements.</li>
            The line moves every sample in 0ms but most parameters in devices/plugins would not be supported to the rate.
          <li>Attract: Represents the ratio how the line movement is attracted by the attractor.</li>
          <li>Position X/Y: Represents the X and Y coordinate of the attractor.</li>
        </ul>
